---Energy System

Energy comes in form of voltronix (VX for short, also WIP name), due to the immense power of VX, accurate measurements can not be performed without repercussions.
VX are transported around by Energetic Relays, which are able to transfer the power of the voltronix storers it is linked to.
Relays do not automatically pick from VX Storers, they must be linked with the appropriate device.
