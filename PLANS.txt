---Energy System

Redesign the conduits, now called relays, the conduits no longer pulls energy from nearby blocks. The relays network is made by
linking relays up to each other, with one end a generator, and another a consumer. The conduits in previous version will be upgrades
to the relays and can store a small buffer of energy. If the consumer needs power, the conduits have power ready to give to the consumer.
Conduits however will be slower in drawing energy unlike, making them a good storage over long distances. "Networks" can be split up by linking multiple relays to one
"intersection" relay. Consumers will be similar conduits, and can link up with relays/conduits and drain from them. Relays can still link to it. But it will not provide power to them.
Generators, or more in general, providers, will be able to provide energy to relays that link to it. An example would be conduits as they can store energy and provide for them
